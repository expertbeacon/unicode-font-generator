In creative writing, italics can convey thoughts, internal dialogue, or subtle nuances, adding depth to the text.

It involves converting your text into a specific subset of Unicode characters that are naturally smaller in appearance. These characters are not merely scaled-down versions of regular letters; they are distinct symbols within the Unicode standard, designed to occupy less vertical space. This distinction is important because it means that small text can be copied and pasted across different platforms without losing its formatting, unlike text that is simply resized in a word processor."
